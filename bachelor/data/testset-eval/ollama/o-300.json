        "topic": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the best topic that represents all these documents. Let me start by looking at each document one by one.\n\nFirst document: It's about CSS classes related to borders and colors. There are mentions of border styles like .border-0, .border-top-0, etc., and different color classes like .border-primary, .border-secondary, up to .border-dark. So this seems to be dealing with styling elements in web design.\n\nSecond document: This one talks about list group items with different colors—like .list-group-item-light, .list-group-item-danger, and so on. It also mentions hover effects and active states for these items. Again, it's about styling components in a user interface.\n\nThird document: Here, the focus is on table styles. Classes like .table-bordered, .table-borderless are mentioned, along with padding and border colors. This is definitely about how tables look in web pages.\n\nFourth document: Similar to the second one, this talks about list group items but also includes badges. It mentions classes like .badge-pill and different badge colors such as .badge-primary. So again, styling elements for UI components.\n\nFifth document: Another set of CSS classes related to alerts—like .alert-primary, .alert-secondary, etc.—with their respective text colors and background colors. This is about how alert messages are styled in a web application.\n\nSixth document: More list group items with different states (success, info, warning) and their corresponding styles. It also includes hover effects and active states for these elements.\n\nSeventh document: Talks about rounded corners using classes like .rounded-sm, .rounded-top, etc., along with border colors. This is about the visual design of UI elements.\n\nEighth document: Focuses on badges again, mentioning different types like .badge-primary and their styling when focused or hovered over. It's consistent with previous documents about styling components.\n\nNinth document: Another set of alert styles, including success and info alerts, with specific color codes for text and backgrounds. This continues the theme of styling UI elements.\n\nPutting it all together, each document is discussing various CSS classes used to style different UI components like borders, tables, list groups, badges, and alerts. The common thread here is web design, specifically the styling aspects using CSS. Each document provides specific styles for different parts of a website or application's interface.\n\nSo, the topic that best represents all these documents would be something related to web design or styling in web development. Since the user asked for the topic in German and between 1-5 words, \"Web Design\" seems appropriate as it encapsulates all the CSS styling elements discussed across the documents.\n</think>\n\n\"Web Design"

        "topic": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the best topic that represents all these documents. Let me start by looking through each document one by one.\n\nFirst document: It's a Vue.js template with some components and imports. There are things like BIconArrowLeft and BButton from bootstrap-vue. The component is named CalendarNavigationArrows, which suggests it's part of a calendar feature. They're using vuex for state management with mutations like SET_PREVIOUS_MONTH.\n\nSecond document: Another script section importing various Vue plugins and components. It mentions draggable from vuedraggable, which might be used for reordering elements. There are also imports related to trumbowyg, which is a rich text editor. This could indicate that the project has some content editing features.\n\nThird document: A template with a list group item linking to \"/Kalender\". The script here uses mapGetters from vuex, so it's fetching data from the store. It seems like another part of the calendar interface, displaying events or something similar.\n\nFourth document: This one imports Slider and Files components. There are also some jQuery plugins for resizing and image handling. This might be a different section of the application, perhaps related to articles or content management with sliders and file uploads.\n\nFifth document: Another list group in Bootstrap Vue, iterating over 'calendars' and displaying their names. The script imports from vuex again, so it's fetching calendar data. This seems like a component that lists available calendars.\n\nSixth document: A script importing multiple components related to the calendar, such as CalendarNavigation, CalendarHeader, etc. It uses mapActions, mapGetters, and mapMutations from vuex, indicating heavy use of state management for the calendar features.\n\nSeventh document: Imports helpers and uses vuex actions. Not sure what exactly this does without more context, but it's part of the Vue setup.\n\nEighth document: A carousel component using Bootstrap Vue. It displays images with captions and descriptions. The script again uses mapGetters from vuex to get data. This could be a gallery or image slider feature.\n\nPutting all these together, most of the documents are related to Vue.js components, especially those dealing with calendars. There's consistent use of vuex for state management across multiple files. Some other parts involve content editing and image sliders, but the majority focus on calendar functionalities like navigation, displaying events, and managing different calendars.\n\nSo, the common thread here is Vue.js applications, particularly focusing on calendar components. The topic should encapsulate that. Since it's in German, \"Vue Kalender\" seems appropriate as it directly translates to \"Vue Calendar,\" accurately representing the main focus of all these documents.\n</think>\n\n\"Vue Kalender"

It's an open-source solution with optional features like calendars and notes, aimed at addressing the digital needs of schools. The company is focused on providing this product with support, targeting various school types but starting with Grundschulen.\n\nSo, the topic should encapsulate that it's about a software or system for schools, developed to meet their specific needs.

Let me start by looking at each document one by one.\n\nFirst document: It has some CSS code snippets about pagination. There are classes like .page-link, .page-item, and mentions of hover states and borders. So this is definitely related to web design or front-end development, specifically dealing with pagination elements.\n\nSecond document: More CSS here, but this time it's about tooltips. Classes like .bs-tooltip-top, .arrow, and some positioning properties are mentioned. Again, this seems like part of a UI toolkit, maybe Bootstrap since I see \"bs-\" prefixes.\n\nThird document: Another set of CSS rules, this time for breadcrumb navigation. There's mention of padding, list styles, and separators. Breadcrumbs are common in web navigation, so another UI component.\n\nFourth document: More tooltip-related CSS, focusing on different placements like right, bottom, top. This continues the theme of UI components, specifically interactive elements that provide additional info on hover or click.\n\nFifth document: This one is about cards. It includes classes like .card-header, .card-title, and mentions padding and margins. Cards are a popular way to structure content in web layouts, so another UI element.\n\nSixth document: Form-related CSS. There's talk about form-inline, form-check, and input groups. Forms are essential for user interaction on websites, so this is definitely part of UI design.\n\nSeventh document: Back to pagination with more classes like .pagination-lg and .page-item. This reinforces the idea that these documents are all about different UI components.\n\nEighth document: More form styling, focusing on inline forms and custom selects. Again, this is about how forms look and function in a web interface.\n\nPutting it all together, each document is a snippet of CSS code defining styles for various user interface elements like pagination, tooltips, breadcrumbs, cards, and forms. They all seem to be part of a larger UI toolkit or framework, possibly Bootstrap given the class prefixes. So the common theme across all these documents is web design, specifically focusing on styling and layout components.\n\nI need to come up with a topic name in German that captures this. The examples provided used \"French Cheese\" for cheese-related documents, so I should find an equivalent term here. Since all documents are about UI elements and their styling, the best fit would be something like \"Web Design\" or more specifically, \"UI-Design\". But since it's about the components themselves, maybe \"Styling-Komponenten\" or \"CSS-Klassen\".\n\nWait, but looking at the example, they used a broader term. So perhaps \"Web Design\" is too broad, and \"UI-Elemente\" might be more precise. Alternatively, considering all these are CSS classes for UI elements, maybe \"CSS-Klassen für UI-Elemente\". But the topic needs to be concise, 1-5 words.\n\nIn German, \"Styling-Komponenten\" could work, but it's a bit technical. Another option is \"Web-UI-Design\", which combines web and user interface design. Alternatively, \"CSS-Layout\" might be too narrow since it's about more than just layout—it's about components like forms, tooltips, etc.\n\nWait, the example used \"French Cheese\" for cheese types, so maybe I should think of a category that encompasses all these UI elements. The best fit would probably be \"Web Design\" or \"UI-Design\". Since the documents are specifically about styling and structure using CSS, perhaps \"CSS-Layout\" is too specific. Alternatively, \"Styling-Komponenten\" might capture it.\n\nBut considering the example used a broader term, maybe \"Web Design\" is better because it's more general and covers all aspects of UI elements. However, since each document is about different UI components styled with CSS, perhaps \"UI-Elemente\" or \"CSS-Klassen\" would be more accurate.\n\nWait, but in German, \"Styling-Komponenten\" might not be the most common term. Maybe \"Web-Design\" is better because it's a well-known term and encompasses all these elements.

Let me start by looking at each document and see what they're about.\n\nFirst document: It looks like some code snippets with functions and variables. There's mention of things like \"Promise\", \"exports\", and various function names. Not sure exactly, but it seems related to JavaScript or a similar language.\n\nSecond document: More code here too. I see terms like \"clone\", \"prototype\", and some method definitions. It might be part of a class structure in JavaScript, maybe dealing with objects or inheritance.\n\nThird document: This one has HTML elements like \"table\", \"tbody\", \"tr\", \"td\". There's also mention of notifications and badges. So this could be related to displaying data in a table format, perhaps for user notifications on a web page.\n\nFourth document: Another code snippet with functions and variables. I see \"focus()\", \"setAttribute\", and some event handling like \"mouseover\". This might be part of a UI component, maybe a dropdown or menu that shows/hides when interacted with.\n\nFifth document: More JavaScript code here. There are functions dealing with arrays, like \"sortedLastIndexOf\" and \"sumBy\". It looks like utility functions for array manipulation.\n\nSixth document: Code again, but this time it's about positioning elements on a page. Terms like \"popper\", \"reference\", \"boundaries\" suggest it's related to positioning UI elements, maybe tooltips or popovers.\n\nSeventh document: This one has more JavaScript functions, dealing with padding strings and parsing integers. It seems like utility functions for string manipulation and number handling.\n\nEighth document: Another code snippet with HTML attributes and event handling. There are mentions of \"radioValue\" and input types, which might be part of form handling or UI components.\n\nNinth document: This looks like SQL keywords such as \"APPLY\", \"OUTER JOIN\", \"RIGHT JOIN\". It seems to be a list of SQL commands, possibly used in a query builder or database interaction.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these documents are code snippets written in JavaScript. They cover various aspects like utility functions, UI components, event handling, and even some SQL keywords. The common thread is that they're all related to programming, specifically JavaScript development. Some might be part of a larger library or framework, while others could be standalone utilities.\n\nI need to find a topic name between 1 to 5 words in German that captures this.

        "topic": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the best topic that represents all these documents provided. Let me start by reading through each document carefully and noting down the key points.\n\nFirst document: Talks about developing new functions with costs around 10,000€ per function. It mentions high initial costs but long-term benefits due to high-quality development avoiding future errors. Also, it's built on open-source software, so no licenses needed but a donation is suggested.\n\nSecond document: Discusses the hours needed for development and that these additional functions must be purchased by customers separately.\n\nThird document: Lists optional features like calendar and notes with specific functionalities. Calendar has colors, start/end times, can be viewed in list or calendar view. Notes have title, RichText, and color.\n\nFourth document: The product is adapted for elementary schools because they are the most common in Germany. They need fewer functions on their websites since students don't use smartphones much. Other school types might need more features like online absence tracking.\n\nFifth document: The founder studies computer science and works at an IT company, contributing to the project's realization. No other supporters currently.\n\nSixth document: Seems like a placeholder or maybe some financial data, but not very informative for topic extraction.\n\nSeventh document: Milestone is teacher training with a date and responsible team.\n\nEighth document: Schools can be contacted via email or phone. Networking between schools and using flyers for new customers planned.\n\nNinth document: Pilot schools pay a cheaper price, 2000€ less in the first year. Prices are transparent on the website.\n\nTenth document: Schools have significant issues with their internet presence; current sites only meet basic needs. The solution is a high-quality, legally secure framework product tailored to school needs, easily customizable. The company Develp4Future will offer this system and support, aiming long-term for all school types.\n\nPutting it all together, the main themes are about developing a web-based system or software specifically designed for schools, particularly elementary ones in Germany. It's an open-source solution with optional features like calendars and notes, aimed at addressing the digital needs of schools. The company is focused on providing this product with support, targeting various school types but starting with Grundschulen.\n\nSo, the topic should encapsulate that it's about a software or system for schools, developed to meet their specific needs. Maybe something like \"Schulsoftware Entwicklung\" which translates to \"School Software Development.\" It covers both the development aspect and the target audience.\n</think>\n\n\"Schulsoftware Entwicklung"

It mentions things like dumps, Telescope, entries loading, etc. This makes me think that maybe the user is dealing with some data management or documentation process within their startup.\n\nPutting it together, I need a sentence that connects someone involved in a startup (probably a developer or a tech-related role) dealing with data or documentation tasks. So something like a developer looking into system data or monitoring entries fits well.
