These techniques are essential in tackling the most significant challenges machine learning engineers face to build, evaluate, run, monitor, and maintain machine learning systems in real-world scenarios. The program also provides hands-on coding assignments, live sessions, feedback, and support to help you build end-to-end machine learning systems from scratch, design, and write code, and learn from years of experience and real-world examples.

Additionally, participants will complete a final project and receive direct feedback on their work.

The program is not an introduction to machine learning and is better suited for those with prior knowledge in the field, but the live sessions will be recorded for those who cannot attend them live. The lifetime access provides flexibility for participants to complete the program at their own pace, regardless of any outside pressures or constraints.

You will design and write the code to build an end-to-end machine learning system starting from scratch, and you will receive direct feedback on your work. The program also includes 18 hours of live, interactive sessions, 10 hours of step-by-step coding instructions, 100 coding assignments, the complete source code of a production system, a private community, and direct access to the instructor.

Program duration: The program consists of six live sessions, each lasting for 3 hours, making a total of 18 hours. There are also 10 hours of step-by-step coding instructions and 100 coding assignments.\n\n2. Program structure: The sessions are a mix of interactive discussions and practical coding sessions. The focus is on learning the first principles of building machine learning systems, the critical questions to ask before starting any project, and strategies for collecting data.\n\n3. Program access: Once you join the program, you have lifetime access to all past, present, and future cohorts. There are no monthly or annual fees, and there are no hidden costs. The program costs $500, and payment is made only once.\n\n4. Program benefits: Apart from the sessions and coding instructions, the program includes the complete source code of a production system, a final project, access to a private community, direct access to the instructor, a program certificate upon completion, and updates to the program.\n\n5. Target audience: The program is designed for beginners to machine learning, but experienced machine learning engineers will also benefit from the first principles approach. The instructor recommends taking a real-world project and applying the techniques learned during the program.\n\n6. Testimonials: The program has received positive feedback from learners, with some describing it as one of the best online courses they've taken. One student called the instructor a terrific teacher, and another recommended the program, stating that it's worth ten times the cost.\n\n7. Instructor: Santiago is the instructor of the program.

The program consists of 18 hours of live, interactive training spread over 3 weeks. Live sessions will take place every Monday and Thursday at 10:00 AM EST, and office hours will be hosted on Wednesdays. The sooner you join, the more time you have to prepare, as lifetime access is included with the one-time payment of $500. Every session is recorded, and you can attend live or watch the recorded version later. The program covers designing, building, deploying, and scaling machine learning systems to solve real-world problems using Amazon SageMaker and open-source tools, with a focus on practical, real-life examples and case studies. Additionally, the program is designed for advanced learners who already know the basics of machine learning and want to learn how to create production-ready systems that work in the real world.", "documents": null}, {"message": "Yes, according to the text, every live session is recorded and you can decide whether to attend live or watch the recording later.", "documents": null}, {"message": "The references provided in the context do not directly answer the question \"What are 'human annotations, natural labels, and weak supervision'?\". However, based on the context, it can be inferred that these are methods or approaches for labeling or categorizing data, with 'human annotations' likely referring to manually labeling data by humans, 'natural labels' potentially referring to inherent labels or categories in the data without additional input, and 'weak supervision' possibly indicating a form of supervision with less training data or less precise labels. Without further context or explanation, it's unclear exactly how these terms are defined or used, but they seem to relate to the topic of labeling data for machine learning and addressing issues such as selection bias.", "documents": null}, {"message": "The text mentions that the program has had over thousands of students graduate since its inception in March 2023. However, it doesn't specify a specific date for when the next cohort will start. The program offers three weeks of live, interactive sessions that students can attend either during the scheduled cohort or watch the recorded version later. The upcoming cohort, Cohort 17, will run from February 3 to February 20, 2025, with live sessions taking place every Monday and Thursday at 10:00 AM EST. If you join the program, you'll get lifetime access, meaning you can participate in as many iterations as you want, including Cohort 17 and future ones, without any additional fees. Therefore, it's up to you when you'd like to join the program and participate in a cohort.
