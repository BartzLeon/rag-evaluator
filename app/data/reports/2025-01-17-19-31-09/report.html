These sampling strategies are used to determine which data points are most beneficial to label in order to improve model performance. Uncertainty sampling selects data points with high uncertainty, which are less confidently classified by the model. Diversity sampling selects data points that are diverse or representative of different regions of the input feature space that the model is unsure about. By using active learning, machine learning engineers can label fewer data points while still improving model performance and reducing the overall cost and time required for model training.","1.

The program is designed to be practical, hands-on, and inclusive, with options for both live sessions and recordings. The program includes live, interactive sessions, step-by-step coding instructions, coding assignments, and access to the source code of a production system. The program&#x27;s emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility suggests that accommodations may be made for participants with disabilities. However, as the context doesn&#x27;t explicitly address this, it&#x27;s unclear what specific accommodations will be provided. It&#x27;s recommended to contact the program&#x27;s instructor, Santiago, or reach out on social media for more information on accommodations for individuals with disabilities.","The course covers two active learning strategies, uncertainty sampling and diversity sampling, to address the problems of selection bias and data diversity. Uncertainty sampling involves selecting the most uncertain samples to label, which helps to reduce the number of required labels and improve model accuracy. Diversity sampling, on the other hand, involves selecting a diverse set of samples to label, which helps to ensure that the model is not overfit to a specific subset of the data. These strategies can be applied in the context of active learning to efficiently and effectively label large datasets for machine learning applications.","&lt;|\\n &lt;|user|\\n function __\\n&lt;|user|assistant\\n function\\n based on \\n&lt;|\\n aim\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt;|user|\\n Based on your homework:\\n Travers\\n\\n thisApriliam found app.\\n\\n&lt;|\\n As \\n based on\\n&lt;|\\n Hire\\n \\n global\\n before\\n&lt;|assistant\\n function keysURL\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|user|user\\n Emanuel\\n&lt;|ass &lt;\\n\\n Jest to\\n&lt;|assistant\\n``&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;st &lt;|\\n\\n&lt;|user\\n\\n&lt;|\\n generates user| as &lt; Can&lt; &lt; &lt; Don&#x27;\\n If you can &lt;}}\\\\HTML Games\\n This work,\\n&lt;\\n&lt; &lt;\\n\\n session ID\\n&lt; &lt;|user\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|ass &lt;|\\n`` Notes:\\n Based on \\n&lt;|\\nand this program will play\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;| &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;|ass\\n\\n&lt;|\\n First Max Treehouse including \\"\\n testimony required unless quoted by\\n\\n this is\\n\\n&lt;|ass &lt;|ass &lt;| &lt;\\n &lt;|assistant\\n before;\\n&lt;\\n&lt; protected \\"Your Go Upcoming from the push outnumber     \\n\\n your\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|assistant form\\n &lt;|user|\\n based on utility\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n\\n R &lt; by\\n classSch &lt; I wishlistings\\"\\n\\n FIT\\n&lt; &lt; \\n&lt;|\\n&lt; &lt; defined &lt; &lt;\\n thoughts &lt; &lt;\\n\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|assistant\\ncpp, \\n&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;\\n&lt;| positioned(be Some more\\n\\n&lt;|user\\n \\"&#x27; thrust Filter &lt;\\n\\n Leap\\n &lt;|assuv\\n NBA:Apr.\\n found app.\\n\\n&lt;\\n#### \\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|ass &lt;|ass &lt; \\n\\n\\n&lt;|system|&gt;\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;|ass &lt;| &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;|&gt;\\n markup\\n&lt;\\n\\n&lt; &lt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n\\nFile&lt;|\\n Actor\\n&lt;|\\n&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; Freder\\n&lt;\\n&lt; &lt; Welcome interpret\\n&lt; &lt;&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n# Finished \\n&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;\\n\\n&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n&lt; Were\\n&lt; &lt;using\\n&lt; &lt;\\n\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user\\n\\n\\n Max Treehouse including further contributed testimony required the quoted by\\n\\n&lt;\\n\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|ass &lt;|\\n &lt;|assistant\\n&lt;|user\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n\\n&lt;&lt;|&gt; push outi&#x27;\\nThose\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|user|\\n(&#x27;&#x27;, but then she does notwh\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|system\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;|ass\\n\\n*** This is\\n\\n&lt; &lt; &lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n &lt;\\\\\\n\\n\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user\\n\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt;| &lt;|&gt;\\n\\n\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user|assistant\\n&lt;|\\n\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|assistant\\n\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\nstmolly Rating: Hirst, Freder\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user\\n```\\n&lt; &lt; &lt;{|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user\\n```\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n\\n&lt;|\\n\\n\\n&lt;|cursed\\n&lt;|\\n\\n&lt;\\n&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;\\n&lt; &lt;\\n\\n&lt;assistant\\n&lt;| user| GOP\\n&lt;\\n&lt;| user|\\n&lt; &lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt; &lt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt; thisApriliam found\\n```\\n&lt;|\\n&lt; &lt; &lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n\\n&lt;| \\n&lt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n\\n\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;N &lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n.\\n\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|user|\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n Welcome, as\\n&lt;\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n# Finished \\n&lt;|user|&gt;\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt;| session ID &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;time Btwitter\\n&lt;|formatted by the price    .\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;&lt; &lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n``&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;|\\n&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;|\\n&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;| system thenuv\\n&lt;\\nApr&lt; &lt;\\n\\n``\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;&lt;\\n\\n&lt; &lt; &lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt; URL\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;| system G &lt; &lt; &lt;|user\\n&lt;| user.\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|st\\n&lt;\\n&lt; &lt;|\\\\user\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;| user\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;| &lt;\\n\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|assistant\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|user\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n&lt;|&gt;\\nyour honor \\n\\n&lt;|\\n\\n\\n&lt;|\\n\\n&lt;|&gt;\\n&lt;|\\n&lt;\\n\\n\\n\\"","The program&#x27;s Cohort 17 has a scheduled time slot of 10:00 AM EST, with live sessions taking place every Monday and Thursday for three weeks, from February 3 to February 20, 2025.

Participants will have access to live, interactive sessions for 18 hours, where they will learn the first principles behind building machine learning systems. They will also receive 10 hours of step-by-step coding instructions for building an end-to-end system from scratch. Additionally, participants will complete a final project and receive direct feedback on their work. There will be 100 coding assignments and practice questions provided, as well as a private community for collaboration with other participants from diverse backgrounds. Direct access to the instructor will be available, and participants will have lifetime access to every past and future cohort of the program. The program certificate will be awarded upon completion, and participants will receive the entire source code of a working production system that they can modify and use as they see fit. The program is not an introduction to machine learning and is better suited for those with prior knowledge in the field, but the live sessions will be recorded for those who cannot attend them live. The lifetime access provides flexibility for participants to complete the program at their own pace, regardless of any outside pressures or constraints. The instructor, Santiago, has over two decades of experience in building and scaling enterprise software and machine learning systems for various clients. He started the program in March 2023 and has already engaged thousands of participants.","Benefits:\\n1.

The program emphasizes the practical aspect of learning, with 18 hours of live, interactive sessions, 10 hours of step-by-step coding instructions, a final project, and 100 coding assignments and practice questions. The program also includes direct feedback on work, a private community, direct access to the instructor, and lifetime access to every past, present, and future cohort. One unique aspect of the program is the focus on unlearning misconceptions about machine learning and providing real-world examples and years of experience. Another unique aspect is the ability to benefit from updates in future cohorts without having to pay again for lifetime access. Overall, the program aims to provide practical skills and insights into building machine learning systems that work in the real world.","Answer: The course discusses the strategies of uncertainty sampling and diversity sampling for active learning. For handling missing values, the course covers imputation techniques for interpreting missing values.","The cost structure for joining the machine learning program is as follows: there is a one-time joining fee, and there are no monthly, annual, or hidden costs. This program is designed for technical professionals with experience in writing code and basic knowledge of machine learning terminology. It is suitable for software engineers, data scientists, data analysts, machine learning engineers, technical managers, and anyone else who wants to use machine learning to solve real-world problems. The program offers lifetime access, with live sessions, coding instructions, a final project, coding assignments, source code, community access, direct instructor access, access to past and future cohorts, and a program certificate upon completion. The commitment required is at least two to four hours per week for the live sessions or to catch up using recordings at a later time. Beginners can also benefit from the program but should expect sessions to go faster than optimal for them. The instructor, Santiago, has over two decades of experience building and scaling enterprise software and machine learning systems, having worked with major clients such as Disney, Boston Dynamics, IBM, and NextEra Energy. If you have any further questions, you can reach out to the instructor on social media.","The program consists of live sessions on Mondays and Thursdays for two hours each, as well as individual work on Tuesdays and Fridays. Optional office hours are held on Wednesdays. The program is not designed for beginners, as basic machine learning terminology is expected. However, prior experience writing code in any language is necessary. The cost to join is $500, which grants lifetime access with no monthly, annual, or hidden fees. Past, present, and future cohorts are included in this access, and new iterations continually improve the program. The program is intended for technical professionals, including software engineers, data scientists, data analysts, machine learning engineers, technical managers, and anyone who wants to use machine learning to solve real-world problems. The instructor, Santiago, is a machine learning engineer with over two decades of experience creating enterprise software and machine learning systems for clients such as Disney, Boston Dynamics, IBM, Dell, G4S, Anheuser-Busch, and NextEra Energy. Live sessions are recorded for those unable to attend in real-time.","..\\n# Since 19.

The program consists of 18 hours of live, interactive training spread over 3 weeks. Live sessions will take place every Monday and Thursday at 10:00 AM EST, and office hours will be hosted on Wednesdays. The sooner you join, the more time you have to prepare, as lifetime access is included with the one-time payment of $500. Every session is recorded, and you can attend live or watch the recorded version later. The program covers designing, building, deploying, and scaling machine learning systems to solve real-world problems using Amazon SageMaker and open-source tools, with a focus on practical, real-life examples and case studies. Additionally, the program is designed for advanced learners who already know the basics of machine learning and want to learn how to create production-ready systems that work in the real world.","Yes, according to the text, every live session is recorded and you can decide whether to attend live or watch the recording later.","The references provided in the context do not directly answer the question \\"What are &#x27;human annotations, natural labels, and weak supervision&#x27;?\\". However, based on the context, it can be inferred that these are methods or approaches for labeling or categorizing data, with &#x27;human annotations&#x27; likely referring to manually labeling data by humans, &#x27;natural labels&#x27; potentially referring to inherent labels or categories in the data without additional input, and &#x27;weak supervision&#x27; possibly indicating a form of supervision with less training data or less precise labels. Without further context or explanation, it&#x27;s unclear exactly how these terms are defined or used, but they seem to relate to the topic of labeling data for machine learning and addressing issues such as selection bias.","The text mentions that the program has had over thousands of students graduate since its inception in March 2023. However, it doesn&#x27;t specify a specific date for when the next cohort will start. The program offers three weeks of live, interactive sessions that students can attend either during the scheduled cohort or watch the recorded version later. The upcoming cohort, Cohort 17, will run from February 3 to February 20, 2025, with live sessions taking place every Monday and Thursday at 10:00 AM EST. If you join the program, you&#x27;ll get lifetime access, meaning you can participate in as many iterations as you want, including Cohort 17 and future ones, without any additional fees. Therefore, it&#x27;s up to you when you&#x27;d like to join the program and participate in a cohort. However, if you want to interact with the instructor and other students in real time, you&#x27;ll need to join the upcoming cohort or wait for the next one.\\n\\nAnswer: It&#x27;s up to you when you&#x27;d like to join the program and participate in a cohort as you&#x27;ll have lifetime access.
