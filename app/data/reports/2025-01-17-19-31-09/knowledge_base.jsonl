{"text":"it with complete confidence.\"Juan OlanoMachine Learning EngineerFrequently Asked QuestionsIf you can't find the answer to your question, please reach out on social media and I'll be happy to help.How long will it take to complete the program?If you are attending the live sessions, you should set aside a minimum of 4 hours every week during the three weeks of the program. This commitment will be enough for engineer leaders or anyone not interested in the coding portion of the program.Those interested in implementing the concepts discussed in class should set aside 2 to 4 hours weekly to complete the code walkthroughs and work on the assignments.Are live sessions recorded?Yes, we record every live session. You can decide when to attend classes live or catch up asynchronously later using the recording.I'm a complete beginner. Is this program helpful for me?This program is not an introduction to machine learning.While we'll discuss many fundamental ideas behind machine learning, beginners"}
{"text":"learning, beginners will find the sessions go much faster than what's optimal for them.What does \"lifetime access\" mean?You only pay once to join the program and get immediate access to every past, present, and future cohort.Every new iteration of the program is better than the ones before. Many students take classes once and then join a later cohort to benefit from the updates.The lifetime access removes any pressure from having to complete the program when life gets in the way.Hey! I'm Santiago.I'm the instructor of the program.I'm a machine learning engineer with over two decades of experience building and scaling enterprise software and machine learning systems.I love neural networks. I love to make them work at scale.From 2009 to 2023, I built products for Disney, Boston Dynamics, IBM, Dell, G4S, Anheuser-Busch, and NextEra Energy, among other clients.
